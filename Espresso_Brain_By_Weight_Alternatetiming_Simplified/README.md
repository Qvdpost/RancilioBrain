# RancilioBrain Simplified

This version of the project only contains a single load cell and a single relais. For some machines you can piggyback the wiring on the brew switch so that can save you a relay. 

If you can get a design working that accurately weighs with only one load cell, and can piggyback the brew switch, this is the source code you'll want to load onto your Arduino.

NOTE: Currently the code for this project is not up to date with the regular project!
